Online gambling and card games have become increasingly popular, especially among college students.  An development studio has decided to branch out to new card games, in order to offer a wider range of products.  This development studio sells these games to online casino web sites via yearly contracts, or by an initial setup fee and royalties on income generated by each game.  The development studio is seeking proposals for virtual card games that it could benefit from adding to its product base for contract to multiple casino hosts.

An additional concern the development studio wants to address is the response speed and strategic difficulty of “fair” computer players.  The online casinos are seeking web games that do not require multiple real players to interact in a single game, but rather games with only one real player.  This allows for games to be played at non-peak hours and prevents the delay that games with no artificial intelligence face when real players take too long to finish their turn.  The online casinos want to prevent loss of players due to boredom from waiting.  They also wish to scale the difficulty of NPC players so that players stay entertained but the casino does not lose money from easy NPC opponents via the betting system.

Thus, the online casinos, and thereby the development studio wish to evaluate NPC strategy, dynamically alter the difficulty of the NPC players, and reduce delay between player turns.
